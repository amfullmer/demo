    <h2>Secret Scribe</h2>
    <p>
      As a playful homage to childhood intrigue, Secret Scribe enables users to encode messages into
      a Caesar Cipher, Morse Code, or Pig Latin, complete with decoding functionality. With this tool at your
      fingertips, you can engage in covert correspondence, keeping the grown-ups in the dark while you unravel the
      mysteries of cryptography.

    <h4>All Hail Caesar!</h4>
    <p>
      Also known as a shift cipher, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank">Caesar
        Cipher</a> is one of the most popular encryption techniques.
      It is named after Julius Caesar and was rumored to be his favored method of sending classified military orders. It
      makes
      sense. The guy loved war.

    <h4>Three Dots and a Dash</h4>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank">Morse code</a> has widely used applications
      including the navy, telegraph communication, and aviation.
      It can be represented visually through dits and dahs, as it is here, but is more often expressed via sound or
      light waves.
      Practice enough and you can tap out Morse code like the skilled operators of the past.

    <h4>Oink Oink</h4>

      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin" target="_blank">Pig Latin</a>. It's a fun way to keep words
      and meaning hidden.
      Talk fast or someone might be able to crack your code.

      Go forth! Have fun! And use the power of Secret Scribe wisely.
