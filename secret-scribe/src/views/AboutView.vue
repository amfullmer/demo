    <h4>
      Caeser Cipher
    </h4>
    <p>
      Also known as a shift cipher, the Caesar Cipher is one of the most popular encryption techniques.
      It is named after Julius Caeser and was rumored to be his favored method of sending military orders. 
    </p>

    <h4>
      Morse Code
    </h4>
    <p>
      Morse code has widely used applications including the navy, telegraph communication, and aviation. 
      It can be represented through dots and dashes, as it is here, but is more often expressed via sound or lightwaves.
    </p>

    <h4>Pig Latin</h4>
    <p>
      Unlike Morse code, many people can and do speak in Pig Latin. It's a fun way to keep words and meaning hidden.
      Talk fast or someone might be able to crack your code.

      Go forth! Have fun! And use the power of Secret Scribe wisely.
